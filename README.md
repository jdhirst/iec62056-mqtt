# IEC62052-21 to MQTT

This project provides a way to send IEC62052-21 data collected from a smart meter (tested with AEM Enerlux TLS) data to Home Assistant via MQTT.

Thanks to @cbergmiller for his [original implementation](https://github.com/cbergmiller/iec62056) of the IEC62056-21 protocol which I used in this project.
